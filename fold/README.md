# Graph_Search

- Graph search using uniform cost search
-   Users are prompted to enter file path, starting city, and final destination
-   nodes generated, expanded, and popped are printed once/if the goal destination has been reached
-   solution path and distance traversed also generated
-   code base includes functions implmenting graph search algorithm with modification to fringe using a priority queue where values are sorted based on g(n) values. Another function is implemented to accurately read in values from the text file.


- Graph search using A-star search
-   Users are prompted to enter file path, starting city, and final destination
-   nodes generated, expanded, and popped are printed once/if the goal destination has been reached
-   solution path and distance traversed also generated
-   code base includes functions implmenting graph search algorithm with modification to fringe using a priority queue where values are sorted based on complete f(n) values where g(n) + h(n) heurisitc. Another function is implemented to accurately read in values from the text file for the graph and additional function is implemented to read in heuristic values from the heuristic text file.
